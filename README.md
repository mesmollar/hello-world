# hello-world
Seriously, the fact that the phrase "hello world" is enshrined for all time is kinda sucky.  Ask me why!

What would have been more appropriate would have been "hello humans"!  The computer is serving us, not the world.  If the computer ends up serving the world then we better clean up our acts or we're in big trouble.  At the least, humans and computers will have some pretty significant "creative differences".

"Say hello; to the rug's topography; it holds quite a lot of interest with your face down on it."
